# Context
Make a program in that reverses a string informed by the user without using any temporary variable, buffer or any pre-existing function or method for this.

## How to run it?

(windows) \
make sure you are in the right path of the exercise\
in the terminal (in this case i am using MingW to compile c++ programs), write "g++ .\main.cpp"\

Then iterate through each character in the array until the null character ('\0') is encountered, counting the number of characters.\
Finally, we display the length of the string
