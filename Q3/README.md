# Context

Make a program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

- For each multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
- For each multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
- For multiple numbers simultaneously of 3 and 5, print "FooBaa", instead of the number.

## How to run it?

(windows) \
make sure you are in the right path of the exercise\
in the terminal (in this case i am using MingW to compile c++ programs), write "g++ .\main.cpp"\
this will make an file called "a.exe" in the same folder, so execute it with ".\a.exe", \
and the program will run!
