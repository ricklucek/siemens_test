Problem #3
Continuing with relation XYZ

What are the sequences of commands to read key value 10 and the next 2 records?

bq                  -> init program
rel XYZ             -> access data structure
rel 10              -> read key value 10
rel n               -> read key value 11
rel n               -> read key value 12
x                   -> exit
