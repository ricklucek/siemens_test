Problem #2

I have a relation XYZ.                          
Its structure is noted below:    

XYZ =  { file (B1) of } record
  B1   : integer;     { block number   B1
  Name : Char8;       { B1 name
end;   

What are the sequence of commands to read the first and last records of relation XYZ?

bq                  -> init program
rel XYZ             -> access data structure
rel 0               -> read first record
rel -1              -> read last reacord
x                   -> exit
