# Repo siemens_test
Store exercises taken in Siemens selective process

## IMPORTANT
Every question is answeared and commented in its respective folder,
for programing languages questions, I used C++ lang and MingW to compile (I used a windows machine), more instructions can be found in every readme.md file

SQL and Linux questions were answeared manually, like using sqlonline compiler or a txt file explaining


### final considerations

I found out some excercises really challenging, especially Q5 involving unit tests and particularly I did'nt feel confortable to answear Q6 due to its complexity.
